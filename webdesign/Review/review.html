                        <b>A good option in Happy Food.</b>
                        I and my friend had dinner here one of the nights we were in Happy Food. The ambiance was good and the food recommendations were great. We had a traditional Arabian rice and chicken preparation, Kuzhi Manthi. It was our first experience having this dish, and although a bit dry, it tasted great. Would recommend this place that's easily noticed from a vehicle and has ample parking.

                        We visited this place for breakfast and dinner. The place is very conveniently located (on the highway ) with ample parking space. The food at both the meals was tasty and definitely worth the price. Good quantity served per portion. Service as also good. Overall , a good place to have food (both local area and highway) when staying in Happy Food. Would recommend it definitely.

                         While the food is undoubtedly a highlight, it's important to note that the restaurant's small size can sometimes lead to a wait.

                       “I’ve been looking forward to trying [food name] at [restaurant] for awhile now,
                        and was so glad that I did! The food was so delicious and the service was really great, too!”
                        The Ichiraku ramen was savoury with the broth being flavor packed. Rengoku's bento was a visual treat and a mix of some great elements. Also tried the Chicken Wontons which were great as well.
                        The highlight, however was the MANGO CHEESECAKE, which was arguably one of the best I've had.

                        Woww, just wow, I've never had English cuisine, nor are there much options for one in NYC, but was so impressed by Lord's. When you walk in, it's like you stepped into tavern straight out of London with its dark and woody amblance. I'm a sucker for aesthetic ceramics and I loveeee the all beautiful chinaware that our dishes were served on. They're all perfectly mismatched, with a floral and tea-party type of aesthetics. It's contrasting to the tavern-like environment yet it fits so well to the dining experience.

                        I recently dined at The Rustic Table, and overall, it was a delightful experience!
                        The moment I walked in, I was struck by the cozy, warm atmosphere. The rustic decor, with wooden beams and soft lighting, made it the perfect spot for a casual dinner.
                        Our server was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. They offered great recommendations and checked in on us just the right amount.
                        For starters, I ordered the roasted beet salad, which was beautifully presented.
